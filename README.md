#Ravelin Design Exercise

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unravelin/design-exercise/master/top_nav.jpg?token=ACOg56ulcJ6ZXLse1zlFDGc2dZpFmaA7ks5X_UB-wA%3D%3D)

##Summary

As you might already know we detect fraud here at Ravelin and we're pretty good at it. The Ravelin dashboard is a client-facing web application that sits on top of our machine learning models. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide our clients insights into their customers, specifically ones tied to fraud â€“ you know, the bad guys.

Your task is to design a notification system for the Ravelin dashboard.

##Spec

We need you to design a notification component that appears when you click the bell icon in the upper right-hand corner. Whether this takes the form of a dropdown modal, sidebar or some other UI element is completely up to you.

This notification component must hold a series of notifications. The sole purpose of these notifications are to make the user aware of important events.

The five different types of events are:

- A fraud ring has appeared
- You have been assigned a customer by another user
- A customer you were watching has just made a suspicious order
- A new queue has been assigned to you by another user
- A reminder that you need to upload your company's chargebacks

While we use [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) as our preferred design tool at Ravelin, this exercise can be done using any tool of your choosing. 

We've included a starter template file in both .sketch and .psd formats to help you get started. The font used throughout the dashboard (Source Sans Pro) is also bundled.

Please try and organise your layers and elements in some sort of logical hierarchy.

**Note:** We're only looking for a final design file (native files please, no JPEGs or PNGs). Bonus points if wireframes or prototypes are included in your deliverables.
