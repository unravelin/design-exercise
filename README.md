#Ravelin Design Exercise

##Summary

As you might already know, Ravelin helps our clients detect fraud through machine learning. The Ravelin dashboard is a client-facing web application, the purpose of which is to provide our clients insight into their customers, specifically ones tied to fraud.

Your task is to design a notification system for the Ravelin dashboard.

##Spec

We need a notification system that appears when you click the bell in the upper-right corner. Whether this takes the form of a pop-out modal, sidebar or other element is up to you.

Notifications might come in the form of alerts that make the user aware of important events.

The four different types of events are as follows:

- A fraud ring has appeared
- Your account has been assigned a customer by another user account
- A customer you were watching has just made a suspicious order
- A new queue has been assigned to you by another user

While we use [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) as our preferred design tool at Ravelin, the design can be done using any tool of your choosing. 

We've included a starter template file in both .sketch and .psd formats to help you get started. The font used throughout the dashboard (Source Sans Pro) is also bundled.

Please try and organise your layers and elements in some sort of logical hierarchy.

**Note:** We're only looking for a final design file (native files please, no JPEGs or PNGs). Bonus points if wireframes or prototypes are included in your deliverables.
