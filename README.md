# Ravelin Design Exercise

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unravelin/design-exercise/master/top_nav.png)

## Summary

As you might already know we detect fraud here at Ravelin, and we're pretty good at it. The Ravelin Dashboard is a web application that provides our clients insights into their customers, specifically ones tied to fraud – you know, the bad guys.

Your task is to design a notification system for the Ravelin Dashboard.

## Spec

Design a notification component that appears when you click the bell icon in the upper right-hand corner. Whether this takes the form of a dropdown modal, tray, sidebar or some other UI element is completely up to you.

This notification component must hold a series of notifications. The purpose of these notifications is to make the user aware of important events. Feel free to go beyond the brief. You will not be penalised for making incorrect assumptions about how a user might interact or take action on these events.

The five different types of events are:

- A fraud ring has appeared
- You have been assigned a "customer review" by another user
- A customer on your watchlist has just made a suspicious order
- A new "review queue" has been assigned to you by another user
- A reminder that you need to upload your company's chargebacks

While we use [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) as our preferred design tool at Ravelin, this exercise can be done using any tool of your choosing. 

We've included a starter template file in .sketch and .fig formats to help you get started. The font used throughout the dashboard (San Francisco Pro) is also bundled.

Please try and organise your layers and elements in some sort of logical hierarchy. If you're using Sketch make use of Symbols and Resizing Constraints.

**Note:** The key thing we're looking for is a final design file (native files please, no JPEGs or PNGs). Bonus points if wireframes or prototypes are included in your deliverables.
